# Project Status

IdleKV is now paper-first. Early phases established the KV-cache access,
eviction, and offloaded-store machinery; the current work centers on
matched-budget repair evidence, paper figures, and robustness experiments for
dynamic between-turn cache repair.

## Current Readout

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Done | Baseline RULER validation exists. |
| P1 | Done enough for support | Degradation harness and task generators exist; tests now collect in repo-wide pytest. |
| P2 | Done | KV round-trip, injection, transfer profiling, and heatmap generation are in place. |
| P3 | Done enough for support | Eviction policies, tests, live smoke, and pilot/full degradation runs exist. |
| P4 | Done enough for support | Host-memory eviction buffer and first profiling pass are implemented. |
| P6 | Active foundation | Matched-budget repair runner, selectors, reporting, first-stage retention hooks, and paper exporters are implemented and tested. |
| P7 | Main evidence | Locked 4Q/6Q matched-budget frontier data are integrated into the paper. |
| P8 | Appendix support | Strict active-cache streaming/spill diagnostics are appendix-only coverage evidence. |
| P9 | Main/appendix support | Operating-regime, proxy-scorer, and paper figure validation are implemented; renderer tests pass. |
| P10 | Active expansion | Specificity controls, 2Q/8Q full frontiers, and the locked five-turn relevance-shift diagnostic are integrated; Llama-3.1-8B passed the locked `n=12` portability gate and is integrated as appendix evidence; selector variants remain staged. |
| P11 | Done | Accumulated-attention retention inspired by H2O on the 4Q full K-grid `n=24` and Llama-3.1-8B 4Q full K-grid `n=24` both passed the main-candidate gate. |
| P12 | Done | Sink-plus-recent policy-breadth `n=24` follow-up passed the gate and is integrated as a main figure with SnapKV and accumulated-attention rows. |
| P13 | Done for current paper | Iterative gates, live-branch audit script, and paired uncertainty checks are implemented. The locked `n=24`, `K=80` five-turn run passed the main gate and is integrated as a main diagnostic with stale-query caveats. |

The main paper currently uses a compact one-column matched-budget raw-score
frontier for 2Q/4Q/6Q/8Q, a specificity-control figure, a locked five-turn
relevance-shift figure, and a first-stage policy-breadth figure covering
SnapKV, accumulated-attention, and sink-plus-recent rows. The 2Q and 8Q curves
both come from full K-grid runs, not endpoint-only breadth evidence. The
appendix contains graph-first robustness views for query-count breadth, the
operating-regime heatmap, selection diagnostics, partition endpoints, scorer
latency, and a cautious same-protocol Llama-3.1-8B cross-family portability
check. The Qwen2.5-3B
same-family transfer result remains fallback appendix evidence rather than
the preferred paper-facing transfer check.

Phase 11 found two positive robustness checks. The accumulated-attention
retention K-grid inspired by H2O and the Llama-3.1-8B full K-grid both pass the
numerical promotion gate and are now reflected in main prose plus appendix
frontiers. The default placement remains appendix unless a compact robustness
figure can be added without overclaiming broad retention-rule or model-family
generalization.

Phase 12 tested a second non-SnapKV policy because it earned the space. The
sink-plus-recent `n=24` K-grid at `B_base=16384` passed the policy-curve gate:
best gain `0.431` at `K=128`, three eligible adjacent positive points,
controls near matched no-repair, and the Gold-K reference covering IdleKV.
The main figure now shows SnapKV, accumulated-attention, and sink-plus-recent
policy rows as a robustness check rather than a broad canonical reproduction
claim.

Phase 13 makes the remaining work explicit rather than ad hoc. Each live idea
must state a reviewer question, diagnose failures, pass unit tests, pass a
minimal smoke, and then pass a written promotion gate before it can enter the
main paper. The locked multi-turn run passed: non-initial IdleKV gain is
`0.542` with paired interval `[0.458,0.620]`, and current-query-only repair
beats stale-query-only repair by `0.307` with paired interval `[0.240,0.370]`.
The next model-transfer step remains a Llama 6Q smoke only if the paper needs
stronger main-readiness evidence.

## Validation

## Notes

- The tracked `saved_results/` directory is the lightweight memory layer for
  early phases. Later phase result trees are mostly ignored and regenerated or
  exported into paper CSVs/figures as needed.
- `models/` is local-only and ignored by git.
- Keep generated LaTeX byproducts out of the repo root. The ICML build
  byproducts under `paper/` are ignored and can be regenerated.
