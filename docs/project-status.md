# Project Status

IdleKV is now paper-first. Early phases established the KV-cache access,
eviction, and offloaded-store machinery; the current work centers on
matched-budget repair evidence, paper figures, and robustness experiments for
dynamic between-turn cache repair.

## Current Readout

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Done | Baseline RULER validation exists. |
| P1 | Done enough for support | Degradation harness and task generators exist; tests now collect in repo-wide pytest. |
| P2 | Done | KV round-trip, injection, transfer profiling, and heatmap generation are in place. |
| P3 | Done enough for support | Eviction policies, tests, live smoke, and pilot/full degradation runs exist. |
| P4 | Done enough for support | Host-memory eviction buffer and first profiling pass are implemented. |
| P6 | Active foundation | Matched-budget repair runner, selectors, reporting, first-stage retention hooks, and paper exporters are implemented and tested. |
| P7 | Main evidence | Locked 4Q/6Q matched-budget frontier data are integrated into the paper. |
| P8 | Appendix support | Strict active-cache streaming/spill diagnostics are appendix-only coverage evidence. |
| P9 | Main/appendix support | Operating-regime, proxy-scorer, and paper figure validation are implemented; renderer tests pass. |
| P10 | Active expansion | Specificity controls, 2Q/8Q full frontiers, and the locked five-turn relevance-shift diagnostic are integrated; selector variants remain staged. |
| P11 | Done | Accumulated-attention retention inspired by H2O on the 4Q full K-grid `n=24` and Llama-3.1-8B 4Q full K-grid `n=24` both passed the main-candidate gate. |
| P12 | Done | Sink-plus-recent policy-breadth `n=24` follow-up passed the gate and is integrated as a main figure with SnapKV and accumulated-attention rows. |
| P13 | Done for current paper | Iterative gates, live-branch audit script, and paired uncertainty checks are implemented. The locked `n=24`, `K=80` five-turn run passed the main gate and is integrated as a main diagnostic with stale-query caveats. |
| P14 | Done for current paper | AdaptFM/test-time-adaptation framing, controlled proxy-scorer validation, Llama portability cleanup, and critical-flaw closure are integrated or promotion-gated. |
| P15 | Appendix diagnostic | The controlled real-repository relevance-shift diagnostic over pinned SWE-bench-pool repositories is complete for this pass: strong against deployable/content-agnostic controls, but appendix-only because the label-assisted AnchorWindow reference remains stronger. |

The main paper currently uses a compact one-column matched-budget raw-score
frontier for 2Q/4Q/6Q/8Q, a specificity-control figure, a locked five-turn
relevance-shift figure, and a first-stage policy-breadth figure covering
SnapKV, accumulated-attention, and sink-plus-recent rows. The 2Q and 8Q curves
both come from full K-grid runs, not endpoint-only breadth evidence. The
appendix contains graph-first robustness views for the real-repository
diagnostic, query-count breadth, the operating-regime heatmap, selection
diagnostics, partition endpoints, scorer latency, and the plotted Llama
portability check that is summarized in main prose. The Qwen2.5-3B
same-family transfer result remains fallback appendix evidence rather than
the preferred paper-facing transfer check.

Phase 11 found two positive robustness checks. The accumulated-attention
retention K-grid inspired by H2O and the Llama-3.1-8B full K-grid both pass the
numerical promotion gate and are now reflected in main prose plus appendix
frontiers. The default placement remains appendix unless a compact robustness
figure can be added without overclaiming broad retention-rule or model-family
generalization.

Phase 12 tested a second non-SnapKV policy because it earned the space. The
sink-plus-recent `n=24` K-grid at `B_base=16384` passed the policy-curve gate:
best gain `0.431` at `K=128`, three eligible adjacent positive points,
controls near matched no-repair, and the SpanRef-K diagnostic covering IdleKV.
The main figure now shows SnapKV, accumulated-attention, and sink-plus-recent
policy rows as a robustness check rather than a broad canonical reproduction
claim.

Phase 13 makes the remaining work explicit rather than ad hoc. Each live idea
must state a reviewer question, diagnose failures, pass unit tests, pass a
minimal smoke, and then pass a written promotion gate before it can enter the
main paper. The locked multi-turn run passed: non-initial IdleKV gain is
`0.542` with paired interval `[0.458,0.620]`, and current-query-only repair
beats stale-query-only repair by `0.307` with paired interval `[0.240,0.370]`.

Phase 14 reframed the paper as test-time adaptation of active KV state and
kept closure work promotion-gated. Phase 15 completed the bounded
real-repository diagnostic: at `K=192`, event-only IdleKV improved exact
identifier accuracy from `0.188` for matched no-repair to `0.729` and beat
random, oldest, stale-cue, wrong-event, and ToolFile controls with positive
paired intervals. The label-assisted AnchorWindow reference reached `0.896`,
so the result is appendix evidence rather than a main selection claim.

## Validation

From the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Most recent focused Phase 15/Phase 6 result:
`69 passed, 16 warnings` on 2026-05-04 after the event-only real-repository
runner, ToolFile/AnchorWindow controls, stricter repair-artifact audit,
repo-level lift summaries, manifest-audit gates, and appendix figure generation
were added. Re-run the full repo-wide suite before a release snapshot.

Most recent paper rebuild:
`paper/scripts/render_paper_figures.py` and
`latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex` both passed on
2026-05-04; the log has no undefined references, undefined citations, or
overfull boxes.

After any paper or figure edit:

```bash
.venv/bin/python paper/scripts/render_paper_figures.py
cd paper && latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
```

## Notes

- The tracked `saved_results/` directory is the lightweight memory layer for
  early phases. Later phase result trees are mostly ignored and regenerated or
  exported into paper CSVs/figures as needed.
- `models/` is local-only and ignored by git.
- Keep generated LaTeX byproducts out of the repo root. The ICML build
  byproducts under `paper/` are ignored and can be regenerated.
