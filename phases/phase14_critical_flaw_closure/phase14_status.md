# Phase 14 Status

Last updated: 2026-05-03 19:58 UTC.

## Implemented

- Added the Phase 14 plan with an explicit idea inventory, smoke design,
  promotion gates, and paper actions.
- Added a readiness audit:
  `phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/audit_phase14_readiness.py`.
- Added smoke wrappers for branches that can be tested with current code:
  proxy scorer controls, Refresh-K frontier, calibrated Llama, and selector
  variants.
- Added unit tests for the readiness audit.
- Expanded the Phase 14 plan into a uniform test loop: reviewer question,
  paper object, code readiness, minimal smoke, automated gate, locked run, and
  paper audit.
- Added automated Phase 14 smoke evaluators for Refresh-K frontiers, calibrated
  Llama smokes, and selector variants.
- Added pre-specified locked-run wrappers for calibrated Llama and selector
  variants, used only after their smoke gates pass.
- Patched the shared Phase 9 artifact summarizer to export
  `IdleKV-Coverage` and `IdleKV-MMR`, because selector-variant smokes were not
  auditable without those columns.
- Incorporated completed expert-agent critiques: keep main text compact,
  foreground tiered-KV promotion, treat Refresh-K as a boundary comparator, and
  require non-saturated cross-model evidence before any main-paper model
  generality claim.
- Tightened the paper latency paragraph and conclusion around the distinction
  between exact research scoring, proxy scoring, and scalable tiered-KV
  score/select/promote mechanics.
- Added a peer-reviewed/archival agent-efficiency latency citation to the
  introduction and latency discussion: published web-agent measurements report
  API/environment wait components, with environment interaction up to `53.7%`
  of total latency. The paper now frames Figure 5 as capacity evidence rather
  than an empirical tool-call duration distribution.
- Added a `paper_guide.md` rule for future runtime/idle-window edits: cite
  agent-efficiency measurements as web-agent API/environment-wait evidence,
  not as a universal tool-call distribution.
- Rebuilt `paper/main.pdf` with `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode
  -halt-on-error main.tex`; the PDF rebuilt successfully.
- Updated `README.md` so the active closure phase points to Phase 14.
- Added `paper/.latexmkrc` and removed regenerated LaTeX intermediates from
  `paper/`; future rebuilds keep aux/log files in `paper/aux/`.

## Validation

- `bash -n phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/*.sh`
- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/*.py phases/phase9_experiment_deepening/scripts/phase9_artifact_summary.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/tests/test_audit_phase14_readiness.py -q`
  - `10 passed`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest phases/phase6_repair/tests/test_runner.py phases/phase6_repair/tests/test_reporting.py -q`
  - `37 passed`
- `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex` from
  `paper/`
  - rebuilt `paper/main.pdf` successfully after the citation/framing edits
  - log scan found no undefined citations or overfull boxes; remaining warnings
    are underfull vboxes from float/page layout

## Initial Readiness Audit

Command:

```bash
.venv/bin/python phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/audit_phase14_readiness.py
```

Result:

- `4q_proxy`: needs controlled proxy smoke or locked run. Existing n=100 proxy
  has strong retained gain and speedup, but lacks Random-K, Oldest-K, and Gold-K
  controls and only has two K points.
- `6q_proxy`: needs controlled proxy smoke or locked run. Existing n=100 proxy
  has large speedup but narrowly misses the strict retained-gain gate and also
  lacks controls.
- `specificity`: boundary result. IdleKV beats stale/donor controls, but
  Refresh-K exceeds IdleKV by `+0.458`, so the paper must frame Refresh-K
  explicitly as full-budget reselection/headroom.
- `llama`: appendix-only portability. The current Llama run has `n=12`, only
  three K values, and saturates at `1.0`.
- `policy breadth`: protocol-matched breadth only, not a faithful named
  prior-policy reproduction. If needed, exact Scissorhands is the next branch.

## Completed Runs

### `phase14_proxy_smoke`

Completed: 2026-05-03 19:42 UTC.

Output:

- `phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/results/proxy_controlled_smoke_n4.csv`

Evaluator:

```bash
.venv/bin/python phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/evaluate_proxy_controlled_smoke.py \
  --summary-csv phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/results/proxy_controlled_smoke_n4.csv
```

Result:

- 4Q controlled proxy smoke passed. At K=96, proxy IdleKV gain is `+0.833`;
  max Random-K/Oldest-K control lift is `+0.042`.
- 6Q controlled proxy smoke passed. At K=96, proxy IdleKV gain is `+0.500`;
  max Random-K/Oldest-K control lift is `+0.042`.

Decision:

- The controlled smoke supports running a locked proxy frontier.
- Before launching the longer locked proxy run, test the Refresh-K boundary
  smoke because it is short and changes paper framing.

## Active Run

`phase14_proxy_locked` is running in tmux.

Command:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s phase14_proxy_locked \
  'cd /home/ubuntu/IdleKV && bash phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/run_proxy_controlled_locked.sh'
```

Purpose:

- Produce controlled, locked proxy-scorer evidence for the scalable repair
  path.
- Settings: 4Q and 6Q, `K={48,64,80,96,128}`, `n=100`, proxy scorer,
  `A/B/B_match/Random-K/Oldest-K/IdleKV/Oracle-K`.
- Progress at 2026-05-03 19:57 UTC: 4Q is active, around example `19/100`
  across three splits; 6Q has not started.

Promotion decision after completion:

- If it passes the controlled proxy evaluator, use it as the primary
  deployment-facing quality/latency bridge.
- If it fails because content-agnostic controls close the gap, demote proxy
  scoring and keep exact scoring as mechanistic evidence only.

### `phase14_refresh_smoke`

Completed: 2026-05-03 19:46 UTC.

Output:

- `phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/results/refresh_frontier_smoke_n2.csv`

Evaluator:

```bash
.venv/bin/python phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/scripts/evaluate_phase14_smokes.py \
  --kind refresh \
  --summary-csv phases/phase14_critical_flaw_closure/results/refresh_frontier_smoke_n2.csv
```

Result:

- Status: `refresh_boundary_confirmed`.
- IdleKV improves over matched at every tested K, but Refresh-K dominates
  IdleKV across the frontier.
- At high K, stale/donor controls get close or equal to IdleKV, so this smoke
  should not become a new main figure. It supports text framing: IdleKV is an
  incremental pre-resume promotion primitive, while Refresh-K is full-budget
  Q2-time reselection headroom.
